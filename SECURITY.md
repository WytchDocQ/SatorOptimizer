# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, email the maintainers (or the repository owner) with a detailed
report including reproduction steps and environment information.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work with you to investigate
and remediate the issue. When appropriate, we will credit you in the release notes.

## Supported versions
We aim to support the latest minor release series. Security fixes may be
backported at the maintainers’ discretion.
